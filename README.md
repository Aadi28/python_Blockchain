# Python Blockchain

This project is about building a bitcoin-like-blockchain using python. It is a proof-of-work blockchain and the user can add nodes to the chain. Each node will broadcast to the neighbouring node and thus the chain will expand. Only the longest chain is valid and thus all other chains will be removed.
